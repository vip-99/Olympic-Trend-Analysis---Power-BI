# Olympic-Trend-Analysis---Power-BI
### This is the Olympic Dashboard Project , Here we have used Power BI to create visual and understand the trend to make data driven decisions




## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of historical Olympic data using Power BI. The dataset spans multiple Olympic Games, offering insights into athlete performances, country rankings, event participation, and medal distribution.

## Objective
- To uncover trends and insights from the Olympic dataset.
- To visualize country and athlete performance over the years.
- To explore medal distribution across sports and events.

## Data Understanding
- **Dataset**: Contains historical data on Olympic athletes, countries, and medal wins.
- **Key Metrics**: Year, Country, Athlete Name, Medal Type, Event, and Sport.
  
## Data Cleaning and Transformation
- Removed duplicates and standardized country names.
